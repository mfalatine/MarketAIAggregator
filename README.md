# Market AI Aggregator

This repository contains two deliberately separate applications. There is no
runtime mode switch and no shared browser storage between them. Local uses
`maa_local_*` keys and Netlify uses `maa_netlify_*` keys.

## Applications

- [`Local/`](Local/) — Codex or Claude subscription CLI only. Start it with
  `Local/MarketAIAggregator_start.bat`.
- [`Netlify/`](Netlify/) — cloud API only. Open its `index.html` directly or
  deploy the folder to Netlify; Anthropic, Gemini, and OpenAI use direct API
  key connections.

Each application owns its HTML, CSS, JavaScript, models, settings UI,
connections UI, Admin UI, build, and tests.

## Mandatory feature-parity rule

When a product feature applies to both applications—profiles, watchlists,
briefing layout, history, deep dives, evidence display, accessibility, themes,
or responsive behavior—the same change must be made and tested in both
folders. This rule is enforced automatically: `pnpm check` runs
`scripts/check-parity.mjs` first, which fails if `styles.css`,
`schemas/briefing.schema.json`, or `scripts/check-project.mjs` differ between
the folders, or if either committed `app.bundle.js` is stale relative to its
source. Mode-specific work stays isolated:

- CLI authentication, executable paths, and subscription models: `Local` only.
- API credentials, provider models, and API tools:
  `Netlify` only.

Run the complete repository verification with:

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm check
```
